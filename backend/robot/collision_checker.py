class CollisionChecker:
    """
    A utility class to perform collision detection for a URDF-based robot using the PyBullet physics engine.

    This class initializes a physics simulation without rendering (headless) and manages a robot model, 
    a planar floor, and custom static obstacles. It provides methods to check for collisions between 
    the robot and itself, the floor, or any added obstacle. It also supports manipulation of the robot's
    joint states and obstacle management within the scene.

    Parameters
    ----------
    urdf_path : str
        The file path to the robot's URDF model to be loaded into the simulation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    robot_model : int
        The unique body ID assigned to the loaded robot model by PyBullet.
    floor : int
        The body ID for the ground plane loaded into the simulation.
    obstacles : List[int]
        A list of PyBullet body IDs for obstacles added to the simulation.
